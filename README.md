# The Name Game
This is a simple demo app designed to show off some basic Android design and library use. The idea is that the user will select
from a variety of game modes. Each game mode being slightly different but they all operate under the same core principle. Show
the user a list of names or faces and then a single instance of the other. The user then has to select the matching face or name 
from the list. The idea is that the code will make a network call to retrieve the information at runtime and not go off
of a prepopulated database.
